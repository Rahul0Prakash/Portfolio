We proposed different interfaces to separate internal and external clients while enhancing usability. Suggested outreach efforts included university partnerships, discounted course bookings, and community engagement to increase visibility among new external clients.</li> <li><b>Reduced Manual Effort</b>: The bundling and modular approach significantly reduces manual intervention by the Flying Lab Factory team, allowing them to focus on delivering quality service and investing in technology upgrades as needed.</li> <li><b>Setting Expectations</b>: The new system sets clear, transparent expectations for both users and service providers. Each interaction is documented, accepted, and tracked, ensuring awareness of deliverables and timelines, thereby improving service quality and reliability.</li>",
