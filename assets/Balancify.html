The interview with the co-founder aimed to capture insights from an expert regarding their expectations and experiences related to the services offered by the FlyingLab Factory. The primary focus was to uncover the team's desired outcomes, assess service demand adequacy, understand their strategic practices, and gauge historical and comparative perspectives about workspace preferences. Additionally, the interview aimed to extract success stories on team-building strategies and identify areas for potential improvement in team functioning or processes. <br> The intention behind the expert user interview was to delve into their specific experiences, preferences, and insights regarding the utilization of FlyingLab Factory's spaces and services. The questions were designed to explore the user's perspective on the usefulness of the facilities, their team dynamics, frequency of usage, memorable experiences, preferences for spaces or services, collaboration experiences, travel management to the facility, utilization of catering services, challenges faced, reasons for potential return visits, suggestions for improvement, interest in a virtual tour of the FlyingLab Factory, and any prior experience with similar services or facilities.
