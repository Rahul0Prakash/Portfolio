MoodGlide - Enhancing Emotional Awareness
Overview MoodGlide is an inclusive emotional regulation device designed to boost emotional awareness and facilitate personal growth. By using an intuitive joystick, users can select among six core emotions, receiving instant haptic and auditory feedback. The device aims to enhance emotional intelligence, improve relationships, and unlock emotional potential for people of all ages, including those with alexithymia.
My Role As the UX designer and developer, I was responsible for:
Concept development and user research
Hardware and software integration
Prototyping and 3D modeling
Conducting user testing and iterating on feedback
This project allowed me to showcase my understanding of both software and hardware tools, including Autodesk Fusion 360 for design and Arduino Micro for prototyping.
The Problem I discovered the problem through observations and interviews with individuals in my circle. Many tended to overestimate certain emotions, often due to recency bias, seasonal affective disorder during less bright months, or other mental struggles they might be experiencing. Responses like, "I've been feeling low more often," led me to explore alexithymia—a condition characterized by difficulty in recognizing and describing emotions—and the importance of emotional awareness for overall well-being. This insight motivated me to address this user need.
Many individuals struggle with recognizing and expressing their emotions, which can hinder personal growth and affect relationships. This challenge is especially prevalent among those with mental health conditions like alexithymia. There was a need for an accessible tool that helps users become more emotionally self-aware.
The Solution MoodGlide offers a tactile and engaging way for users to interact with and track their emotions. Key features include:
Effortless Emotion Selection: An intuitive joystick interface allows users to toggle between six core emotions—happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust, based on Paul Ekman's theory of universal emotions.
Inclusive Design: Braille labels and clear emoticons make the device accessible to users with visual impairments.
Auditory & Haptic Feedback: Immediate feedback enhances user interaction and confirms emotion selection.
Reminders for Use: Gentle nudges encourage consistent emotional check-ins throughout the day, facilitated by a real-time clock module.
Emotion Tracking: The device logs date, time, and selected emotions to help users identify patterns over time.
User Demographics
High-Stress Professionals: Individuals in demanding jobs seeking better emotional management.
Individuals with Mental Health Conditions: Especially those who find it challenging to recognize or express emotions, such as people with alexithymia.
Students and Educators: Those in educational settings looking to manage stress and improve emotional awareness.
Process
Hardware & Software Integration
Hardware: Arduino Micro, joystick, buzzer, vibration motor, battery, and a real-time clock module.
Software: Autodesk Fusion 360 was used for 3D modeling, and the Arduino platform was used for programming.
Prototyping: Utilized Ultimaker S5 3D printer with PLA filament for a durable prototype.
Prototyping and Development
The joystick enables users to effortlessly switch between six basic emotions. Accessible emoticon labels and Braille were incorporated to ensure inclusivity for visually impaired users.
Haptic feedback (vibration motor) and auditory signals (buzzer) provided immediate confirmation of emotion selection, enhancing engagement.
The real-time clock module managed reminders, prompting users to engage with the device throughout the day.
